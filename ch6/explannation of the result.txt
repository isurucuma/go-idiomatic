Certainly! The output you provided is related to garbage collection (GC) in Go. Let's break down each line:
- General Format:
    - Each line represents a garbage collection cycle (GC cycle).
    - The format of each line is as follows:

gc <cycle_number> @<timestamp> <percentage>: <pause_time> ms clock, <cpu_time> ms cpu, <heap_size_before>-><heap_size_after>-><heap_goal> MB, <stacks_size> MB stacks, <globals_size> MB globals, <P>

- Explanation of Fields:
    - <cycle_number>: The sequential number of the GC cycle.
    - <timestamp>: The time when the GC cycle occurred (in seconds).
    - <percentage>: The percentage of CPU time spent on GC during this cycle.
    - <pause_time>: The total pause time (time spent in GC-related activities) during this cycle.
    - <cpu_time>: The total CPU time spent in GC-related activities during this cycle.
    - <heap_size_before>: Heap size (in MB) before the GC cycle.
    - <heap_size_after>: Heap size after the GC cycle.
    - <heap_goal>: The target heap size (goal) for the GC.
    - <stacks_size>: Stack size (in MB).
    - <globals_size>: Globals size (in MB).
    - <P>: The number of processors (P) used for GC.
- Interpretation:
    - The GC cycle is triggered automatically by the Go runtime to manage memory.
    - The goal of GC is to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable (garbage).
    - During each cycle, the program execution is paused (<pause_time>), and the GC performs its tasks.
    - The CPU time spent in GC activities is shown as <cpu_time>.
    - The heap size (<heap_size_before> and <heap_size_after>) changes as memory is allocated or freed.
    - The <heap_goal> represents the target heap size.
    - The stack and globals sizes are also reported.
    - The <P> value indicates the number of processors used for GC.
- Example Interpretation:
    - For example, in the first line:
        - GC cycle number 1 occurred at timestamp 0.003 seconds.
        - The GC spent 2% of CPU time.
        - The total pause time was 0.009 ms.
        - The total CPU time spent in GC activities was 0.077 ms.
        - The heap size changed from 8 MB to 8 MB (no change).
        - The goal heap size is 8 MB.
        - There were no stacks or globals.
        - 8 processors were used for GC.
- Overall:
    - These lines provide insights into how the Go runtime manages memory and performs garbage collection.
    - The specific values (such as heap sizes, pause times, and CPU times) vary based on your program's behavior and memory usage.
Remember that GC behavior can vary depending on factors like memory allocation patterns, heap growth, and the specific workload of your program . ðŸ˜Š
